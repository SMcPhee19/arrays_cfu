- Appolgies for the two .rb doccuments in the repository. I opened the the file and didn't put the space between the file name and the period in the terminal. so it opened as ".arrays.rb" I thought about deleting that file, but it has my other commits on it so the file "arrays.rb" would have all the information as the other file but only the initial commit from when I started it. 

- arrays feel good. Only hiccups weren't to do with arrays specifically. I just got a little mixed up in the terminal.
- I want to work a little more with the methods of calling an array, push, shuffle, shift, unshift, etc. Some of the explanations given weren't as helpful as others that I found. 
- When an array is shifted, do the values following the value that was shfited get their own array?
